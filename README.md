# Loan Default Prediction Model

## Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan applicant
is likely to default based on financial, credit, and asset data.

## Dataset
Loan approval dataset containing applicant income, loan amount,
credit score (CIBIL), asset values, and loan status.

## Approach
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding & Scaling
- Random Forest Classification
- Model Evaluation using ROC-AUC and Recall

## Results
The model helps identify high-risk applicants, supporting
better credit risk decisions and reduction in NPAs.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
